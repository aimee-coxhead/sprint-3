What happens to the layout when you resize the screen to less than 550 px. How do you think that works?

When you resize the screen to less than 550px everything moves to fit the new screen size. This means that the content is now shown in one column instead of being in two or three columns when the screen is more than 550px. I think this was done by using media queries.

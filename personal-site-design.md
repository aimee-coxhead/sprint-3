What is you site's primary purpose? 
To keep a record of my journey through Phase Zero and what I have learnt.
<br>
Who is your target audience?
Myself, other students who are doing Phase 0 and those who would like to read about what I am learning/ have learnt.
<br>
How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?
I want the information to be clearly laid out and easy to read. It also needs to be easy for users to use and navigate through the site. 
<br>
How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?
I would really like my pages (with the exclusion of the home page) to have the same layout so that people know what to expect. I would also like to have a drop down navigation bar at the top (that is the same on every page) so people are able to move around the site easily.
